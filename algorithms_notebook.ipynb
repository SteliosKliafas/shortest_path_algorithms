    "\n",
    "Below is the implementation of the functions responsible for creating the 'board' of our game, the Integer Maze and the corresponding Adjacency Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function 'create_maze' generates a 2D array (h x w) by requesting the user to input its dimensions, (its height (h) and width (w)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently receiving as input the integer maze, the functions 'create_row' and 'adjacency_matrix_distance' are accountable for the manifestation of the Adjacency Matrix, taking into account that the agent can only move 1 cell up, down, left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedure of creating the Adjacency matrix the idea is to consider each cell of the Integer Maze as a vertex, for example a 3 by 3 matrix will have a total of 9 vertices, and the weight of the edge for moving from cell A to a neighbouring cell B will be equal to the number 'encapsulated' on cell B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function create_maze, we create an Integer Maze (height x width) by letting the user choose its dimensions filled with integers from 0-9, while also checking if the user provided appropriate integer inputs, if not we throw a Value Error exception. Finally, we set the starting and end points value equal to 0 assuming agent has already spent some time (x) on starting point and 0 to the end point since agent has arrived at its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function create_row is being called by the adjacency_matrix_distance function to create the rows of the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "Each row of the adjacency matrix will be equal to the number of cells of the grid initially filled with value NaN. Within the x, y loop we check the values of the Integer Maze and we replace the NaN value if the point is neighbouring and thus the agent can move to it directly. Finally, we concatenate the arrays to create a row for the 2D matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, function adjacency_matrix creates the two-dimensional adjacency matrix denoting all paths between the nodes once all the necessary rows  have been created from by the 'create_row' function which takes as input the integer maze.\n",

    "#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "As my first baseline algorithm I chose to implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which finds the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. Floyd's-Warshall's algorithm can work for directed and undirected graphs with positive and negative weighted edges but not with graphs containing negative cycles. \"In graph theory, a 'cycle' in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices. A 'directed cycle' in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices.\"[^1] \"A 'negative cycle' (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, means that there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle.\"[^2] This implementation of the algorithm also contains a path reconstruction function, to show the shortest path found in the integer maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "In floyd_warshall function we implement the main code for the algorithm, finding the shortest paths for all pairs of vertices.\n",
    "First, we initialize the distance, and path arrays, from which we will recover the shortest path and its cost value.\n",
    "In the first for loop we replace the values of each line equal to their vertex, if there is no path through a vertex k then\n",
    "you can get straight from i. In the second for loop we evaluate if there is a shorter path from vertex i to vertex j through a vertex k, if there is update the shortest distance in the fw_distance_matrix, if not keep the shortest distance from i to j as it is. Furthermore, we create a path matrix of similar dimensions to pass it to the \"reconstruct_path\" function in order to get all the visited nodes. Each line in the adjacency matrix represents a vertex and all the paths from that vertex to the rest. If there is a distance shorter through a vertex k instead of going straight from i to j replace, the vertex in the path matrix (np arrays support accessing indexes with point notation [x, y]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we create a recursive function, constructing the path untill our destination is reached. This function takes as arguments the path_matrix, the destination which is updated untill it is equal to the source, and the path which is being constructed. We initiate our path variable as an argument because if we constructed it inside the recursive function it would be set to empty every time a recursion occurs.\n",

    "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an algorithm influenced by the natural mechanisms found in real ant colonies, it is a metaheuristic population based probabilistic model, that uses artificial ants to provide solutions to optimization problems. In this model, artificial ants try to find the shortest path on the Integer Maze from source to destination by using the amount of pheromones and the grade of vision to adjacent destinations. While on a path, artificial ants emit a substance called 'pheromone' which evaporates over time, increasing the likelihood of consecutive ants to follow paths with increased pheromone levels. Since pheromone evaporates, shorter paths will have increased quantities of compound and will be more likely to be followed by subsequent ants compared to longer paths. Another factor that affects the decision making of ants is the distance between the points to be followed, in this case we demonstrate these two factors in two arrays called 'pheromone_matrix' and 'visibility_matrix' which are equal to the dimensions of the adjacency matrix. \n",
